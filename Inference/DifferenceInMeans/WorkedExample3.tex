\noindent
The working lifetimes of 100 of both of two different types of batteries were observed. The mean lifetime for the sample of type 1 batteries was 25 hrs with a standard deviation of 4hrs. The mean lifetime for the sample of type 2 batteries was 23 hrs with a standard deviation of 3hrs. 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Test the hypothesis that the mean working lifetimes of these batteries do not differ at a significance level of 5\%.
\item 
Calculate a 95\% confidence interval for the difference between the average working lifetimes of these batteries. Using this confidence interval, test the hypothesis that battery 1 on average works for 3 hours longer than battery 2.

\subsection*{Statement of Hypotheses}
\noindent The first step in hypothesis testing is to specify the null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis.
\begin{itemize}
    \item The Null Hypothesis ($H_0$) proposes that there is no difference in terms of battery lifetimes between the two types of battery.
    \item The Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$) proposes that there is a difference in terms of battery lifetimes between the two types of battery.
\end{itemize}
\begin{description}
\item[$H_0$:] $\mu_1 = \mu_2$ ( The population means are equal)
\item[$H_1$:] $\mu_1 \neq \mu_2$ (The population means are different)
\end{description}

\noindent Equivalently, we can write the hypotheses in terms of difference between groups.
\begin{description}
\item[$H_0$:] $\mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0 $ 
\item[$H_1$:] $\mu_1 - \mu_2\neq  0$ 
\end{description}



\noindent (Remark: Two Tailed Test, therefore $k = 2$, and $\alpha = 0.05$)

\subsection*{Computing the Test Statistic}

\noindent \textbf{Standard Errors}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The Standard Error Formula are typically provided in the exam paper, or an accompanying document.
    \item Each type of test has a different Standard Error Formula.
\end{itemize}
\begin{framed}
 The relevant formula for the standard error is
\[ S.E(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2) = \sqrt{{s^2_1\over n_1}+{s^2_2 \over n_2}} \]
\end{framed}
\bigskip
\begin{itemize}
\item $s^2_1$ and $s^2_2$ is the variance of samples $1$ and $2$ respectively.
\item $n_1$ and $n_2$ is the sample size of both samples.\bigskip

\end{itemize}
\begin{eqnarray*}
 S.E(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2) &=& \sqrt{ \frac{4^2}{100} + \frac{3^2}{100} } \\
& & \\
&=& \sqrt{ 0.25  }\\
& & \\
&=& 0.50
\end{eqnarray*}
\newpage 

\noindent \textbf{General Structure of the Test Statistic}\\
\noindent The Test Statistic $TS$ is a Normally  Distributed random variable with $TS \sim Z(0,1^2)$.
\begin{framed}
\[ TS = {\mbox{Point Estimate} - \mbox{Expected Parameter Value under $H_{0}$} \over \mbox{Std. Error}}\]
\end{framed}


\begin{eqnarray*}
TS &=& \frac{ 2\;-\; 0}{0.50} \\
& & \\
&=& 4\\
\end{eqnarray*}

\subsection*{Determine the Critical Value}

\begin{itemize}
\item The critical value is determined from Statistical Tables.
\item Determination depends on the significance level $\alpha$, the sample size $n$ and the number of tails in the test (i.e. is it a one-tailed or two tailed test.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Significance Level}

\begin{itemize}
\item In hypothesis testing, the significance level $\alpha$ is the criterion used for rejecting the null hypothesis. 
%\item The significance level of a statistical hypothesis test is a fixed probability of wrongly rejecting the null hypothesis $H_0$, if it is in fact true.
%\item Equivalently, the significance level (denoted by $\alpha$) is the probability that the test statistics will fall into the \textbf{\emph{critical region}}, when the null hypothesis is actually true. 

\item In University courses, common choices for $\alpha$ are $0.05$ and $0.01$. We will use $\alpha =0.05$ (i.e. 5\%).
\item We have a large aggregate sample size ($n_1 + n_2 > 30)$.
\item The hypothesis test is 2-tailed procedure.
\item The Critical Value is 1.96.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision}



\begin{framed}
\noindent \textbf{What are the conclusions}
	\begin{itemize} 
		
		\item[Yes:] We \textbf{reject the Null} Hypothesis. \\ \textit{We have sufficient evidence against Null Hypothesis.}
		
		\item[No:] We \textbf{fail to reject} Null hypothesis. \\ \textit{We do not have sufficient evident against Null Hypothesis.}
	\end{itemize}	
	{	\normalsize
		N.B. Note the terminology that we are using. Also note exactly what our conclusion is: We are talking about strength of evidence, rather than what is true or false.}
	
\end{framed}
	\smallskip
\begin{framed}
\begin{itemize}
	\item 	If $TS > CV$ , where $CV$ is a critical value corresponding to the sample size and confidence level, then reject the null hypothesis. 
	\item  If $TS \leq CV$ , we fail to reject the null hypothesis. i.e. Not enough evidence of a significant difference. 
	\end{itemize}	
\end{framed}	

\noindent Here $TS >CV$ , i.e. ($4 > 1.96$), we will reject the null hypothesis. i.e. sufficient evidence of a difference in meanlifetimes of battery life.
