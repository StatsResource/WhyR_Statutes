63 of 100 first time convicts serving at least 3 years re-offended, whereas 70 of 140 first time convicts serving less than 3 years re-offended. 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item	Test the null hypothesis that the re-offending rate does not depend on the length of the first sentence at a significance level of 5\%.
% \item 	Calculate a 95\% confidence interval for the difference in the re-offending rates of these two groups.
% \item 	Based on this confidence interval, is there any evidence that the re-offending rates differ?

\subsection*{Statement of Hypotheses}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The Null Hypothesis ($H_0$) proposes that there is no difference in reoffending rates between the two groups of convicts.
    \item The Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$) proposes that there is a differencein reoffending rates between the two groups of convicts.
\end{itemize}
\medskip 
\begin{description}
\item[$H_0$:] $\pi_1 = \pi_2$  - i.e. Population proportions are equal to each other.
\item[$H_1$:] $\pi_1 \neq \pi_2$ - i.e. Population proportions are different to each other.
\end{description}
\medskip
\noindent Equivalently, the hypotheses can be expressed in terms of difference in proportions.
\begin{description}
\item[$H_0$:] $\pi_1 - \pi_2= 0 $ - i.e. Difference in population proportions is zero.
\item[$H_1$:] $\pi_1 - \pi_2 \neq 0$ - i.e. Difference in population proportions is not zero.
\end{description}

\subsection*{Computing the Test Statistic}
\noindent \textbf{Point Estimate}

\begin{itemize}
     \item The sample proportions for both groups are
    \[ \hat{p}_1 = \frac{63}{100} = 0.63 \;\;(\mbox{i.e.}\; 63\%) \] 
    \[ \hat{p}_2 = \frac{70}{140} = 0.50 \;\;(\mbox{i.e.}\; 50\%) \]  
    \item The point estimate is the difference between these proportions:
    \[ \hat{p}_1  - \hat{p}_2  = 0.13 \;\;(\mbox{i.e.}\; 13\%) \]
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Standard Errors}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The Standard Error Formula are typically provided in the exam paper, or an accompanying document.
    \item Each type of hypothesis test has a different Standard Error Formula.
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
\begin{framed}
\noindent \textbf{Standard Error for Difference in Proportions}\\
\noindent {Two large independent samples}
\begin{eqnarray*}
	S.E.(\hat{P_1}-\hat{P_2})&=&\sqrt{ \bar{p}\times(1-\bar{p}) \times \left(\frac{1}{n_1}+\frac{1}{n_2}\right)}.\\
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\bar{p}$ is the overall proportion
\[    \bar{p} = \frac{x_1 + x_2}{n_1+n_2}\]
\end{itemize}
\end{framed}
\[    \bar{p} = \frac{63 + 70}{100+140} = \frac{133}{240} = 0.5541 \]


\noindent Using percentages, the aggregate proportion is 55.41\%.

\begin{eqnarray*}
	S.E.(\hat{P_1}-\hat{P_2})&=&\sqrt{ 55.41 \times 44.59 \times \left(\frac{1}{100}+\frac{1}{140}\right)}.\\
	&=&\sqrt{ 2470.732 \times 0.01714}.\\
	&=&\sqrt{42.3483}\\
	&=& 6.5075 \\
\end{eqnarray*}

\noindent \textbf{General Structure of the Test Statistic}
\begin{framed}
\[ TS = {\mbox{Point Estimate} - \mbox{Expected Parameter Value under $H_{0}$} \over \mbox{Std. Error}}\]
\end{framed}

\begin{eqnarray*}
TS &=& \frac{ 13\;-\; 0}{6.5075} \\

&=& 1.9976\\

\subsection*{Determine the Critical Value}

\begin{itemize}
\item The critical value is determined from Statistical Tables.
\item Determination depends on the significance level $\alpha$, the sample size $n$ and the number of tails in the test (i.e. is it a one-tailed or two tailed test?)
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Significance Level}

\begin{itemize}
\item In hypothesis testing, the significance level $\alpha$ is the criterion used for rejecting the null hypothesis. 
%\item The significance level of a statistical hypothesis test is a fixed probability of wrongly rejecting the null hypothesis $H_0$, if it is in fact true.
%\item Equivalently, the significance level (denoted by $\alpha$) is the probability that the test statistics will fall into the \textbf{\emph{critical region}}, when the null hypothesis is actually true. 

\item In University courses, common choices for $\alpha$ are $0.05$ and $0.01$. We will use $\alpha =0.05$ (i.e. 5\%).
\item We have a large aggregate sample size ($n_1 + n_2 > 30)$.
\item The hypothesis test is 2-tailed procedure.
\item The Critical Value is 1.96.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Decision}



\begin{framed}
\noindent \textbf{What are the conclusions}
	\begin{itemize} 
		
		\item[Yes:] We \textbf{reject the Null} Hypothesis. \\ \textit{We have sufficient evidence against Null Hypothesis.}
		
		\item[No:] We \textbf{fail to reject} Null hypothesis. \\ \textit{We do not have sufficient evident against Null Hypothesis.}
	\end{itemize}	
	{	\normalsize
		N.B. Note the terminology that we are using. Also note exactly what our conclusion is: We are talking about strength of evidence, rather than what is true or false.}
	
\end{framed}
	\smallskip
\begin{framed}
\begin{itemize}
	\item 	If $TS > CV$ , where $CV$ is a critical value corresponding to the sample size and confidence level, then reject the null hypothesis. 
	\item  If $TS \leq CV$ , we fail to reject. null hypothesis. i.e. Not enough evidence. 
	\end{itemize}	
\end{framed}	

\noindent Here $TS > CV$, i.e. ($2.00 > 1.96$), so we reject the null hypothesis. i.e. evidence of a significant difference.
