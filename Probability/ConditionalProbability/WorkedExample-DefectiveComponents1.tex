\noindent A computer manufacturer produces hard drives for laptops at plants located in Cork, Glasgow and Budapest; 40\% in Cork, 35\% in Glasgow and the remaining 25\% in Budapest.\\

\noindent The probability that a hard drive will be found to be defective upon receipt by a customer is 0.015 if shipped from Cork, 0.01 if shipped from Glasgow, and 0.02 if shipped from Budapest.

\begin{itemize}
\item[(a)]What is the probability that a hard drive selected at random at a customer location will be found to be defective?
\item[(b)]Suppose a hard drive selected at random is found to be defective upon arrival at a customer location. What is the probability that it was manufactured in Cork?

\noindent \textbf{Part (a)}\\
What is the probability that a randomly selected hard drive fails the quality control test?\\
\medskip
\noindent Compute $P(F)$ 

\[P(F) = P(F \mbox{ and } B) + P(F\mbox{ and }C) + P(F\mbox{ and }G)\]
Re-arranging the conditional probability formula
\[P(F) = P(F|B)\times P(B) +  P(F|C)\times P(C) +  P(F|G)\times P(G)
\]
\[P(F) = 0.02 \times 0.25 +  0.015 \times 0.40 +  0.01 \times 0.35
\]
\[P(F) = 0.005  +  0.006  +  0.0035 = 0.0145
\]

\noindent \textbf{Part (b)}\\


\noindent What is the probability that a randomly selected hard drive comes from cork, given that it fails the quality control test?\\ 
\noindent Compute $P(C|F)$ 
\[P(C|F) = \frac{P(F\mbox{ and }C)}{P(F)} = \frac{0.006}{0.0145} = \boldsymbol{0.4137} \]
