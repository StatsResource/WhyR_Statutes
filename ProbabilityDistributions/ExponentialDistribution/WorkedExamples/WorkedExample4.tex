\subsection*{The Exponential distribution}
The average lifespan of a laptop is 5 year. You may assume that the lifespan of laptop computers follows an exponential distribution. Useful calculations are provided with each question.

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item What is the probability that the lifespan of the laptop will be at least 6 years.
	\[e^{-6/5} = 0.3011942\]
	\medskip
	\item What is the probability that the lifespan of the laptop will not exceed 4 years.
	\[e^{-4/5} = 0.449329\]
	\medskip 
	\item What is the probability that the lifespan of the laptop will be between 5 years and 6 years.
	\[e^{-5/5} = 0.3678794\]
\end{enumerate}
