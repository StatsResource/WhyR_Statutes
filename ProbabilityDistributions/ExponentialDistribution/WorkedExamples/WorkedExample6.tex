\subsection*{Exponential Distribution Problem}
\noindent Suppose that the average waiting time for queuing in a bank is 10 minutes.
What is the probability that a customer will spend more than 15 minutes queuing in the bank?
\[
P (X \geq 15) = e ^{-15\lambda}
= e ^{-3 / 2}
= 0.22
\]
\bigskip

\noindent What is the probability that a customer will spend more than 15 minutes in the bank given that they are still in the bank after 10 minutes?
\[
P (X \geq 15|X \geq 10) = P (X \geq 5) 
= e ^{-1 / 2}
= 0.604
