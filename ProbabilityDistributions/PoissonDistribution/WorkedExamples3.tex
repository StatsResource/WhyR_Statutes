	\section*{Example}
	Suppose that electricity power failures occur according to a Poisson distribution
	with an average of 2 outages every twenty weeks. 
	\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
		\item  Calculate the probability that there will
		not be more than one power outage during a particular week.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	\noindent \textbf{Solution:}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  The average number of failures per week is: $m = 2/20 = 0.10$
		
		\item  ``Not more than one  power outage" means we need to compute and add the probabilities for ``0 outages" plus ``1 outage".
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	
	Recall: \[P(X = k) = e^{-m}\times \frac{m^k}{k!}\]
	
	
	\begin{itemize}
		
		\item  $P(X = 0)$
		
		\[P(X = 0) = e^{-0.10} \times \frac{0.10^0}{0!} = e^{-0.10} = 0.9048\]
		
		
		\item  $P(X = 1)$
		
		\[P(X = 1) = e^{-0.10}\times \frac{0.10^1}{1!} = e^{-0.10}\times 0.1 = 0.0905\]
		
		\item  $P(X \leq 1)$
		
		\[P(X \leq 1) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) = 0.9048 + 0.0905 = 0.995\]
		
	\end{itemize}
